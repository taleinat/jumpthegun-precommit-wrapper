# jumpthegun-precommit-wrapper
A wrapper for pre-commit to launch Python tools via JumpTheGun

Simply install this instead of pre-commit, e.g.:
```shell
pipx install jumpthegun-precommit-wrapper
```

Then run `jtg-pre-commit` whenever you'd normally run `pre-commit`
and enjoy it being much snappier!
